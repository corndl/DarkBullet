# Rituosity

http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/rituosity 

Full-throttle arcade madness! A game that thrust you into the skin of malicious 
flying entity eager to purge the city's population in a dark and secular ritual. 
Simple controls require players to simply move their mouse to guide the entity 
from victim to victim, gaining speed with each kill! This game was designed and
created for compatibility with Google Cardboard, but it's perfectly awesome using 
just your house mouse, so give it a go! VOTE BERNIE SANDERS! 

This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2016.
